# x-types

A library of data types and structures for C.

Types to be implemented

- [x] vector
- [x] dequeue
- [x] optional
- [x] stack
- [x] queue
- [x] priority_queue
- [x] node
- [x] single node
- [x] single linked list
- [x] double linked list
- [x] set
- [x] unordered_set
- [ ] map
- [ ] element
- [ ] ring
- [ ] treemap
- [ ] tuple
- [ ] hashtable
- [ ] hashset
- [ ] tree
- [ ] heap
- [x] xstring

## Todo

- add_all in containers
- extend list with other contigiuos related operations
- add container##T##_remove to remove by element
- add container##T##_index_of
- add remove with cb, remove_all with cb

## Doc hints

- vector store element in contiguous memory locations
- xoptional does no memory allocation
- xiterator works for any struct with Iterator and size field
